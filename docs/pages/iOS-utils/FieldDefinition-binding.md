### FieldDefinition binding

The iOS library provides a function that allows you to bind the publisher in your Swift code with the real-time status generated by the FieldDefinition

<pre><code class="swift">
    formModel.form
      .field(id: FormModel.companion.USERNAME)?
      .bindStatus(withPublisher: &$usernameStatus)
</code></pre>
<p class="comment">Example extracted from the iOS example app.</p>

In this case, `usernameStatus` is a `@Published` variable functioning as a publisher being observed. Within the `bindStatus` function, we observe the status of the `FieldDefinition` and bind it with `usernameStatus`.
